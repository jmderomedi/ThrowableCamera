### Licensing ###
The code and other files contained in this repo are beer-ware, which is open and available for public use. All the files in this repo are free to use but please consider buying me a beer if you use them. This project was created by me to gain knowledge in the Arduino language and my first steps into dealing with hardware.

### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is for the code documentation of the Throw-able Camera project. The camera works by once it is thrown in the air, at the peak it will take multiple panoramic shots of the area. There was major work done on the code before using this repo. The code is being rewritten and this repo will be used.

Version: Pre-Alpha 1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

Setup:
This is the current list of devices needed.
>
>

Configuration:
**Examples of how to download**
Arduino IDE is needed to run the code. All other configuration is completed by the code.

Dependencies:
Currently the code is created to be used specifically with the hardware listed above. Any other hardware can cause unexpected data or errors.
The libraries are hardware dependent.

Test Running:
There will be a library that will be dependent on the code that can be used to run tests and debugging.

Deployment:
Once the hardware is set up and the code is uploaded to the Arduino IDE, the device will work properly. There will be attached CAD files for printing
out a case for the hardware. There will also be a file on assembly.

### Contribution guidelines ###

Writing Tests:
Please feel free to create your own test code. If you would like you may share it with me and I will place it on this repo.

Code Review:
If you see a error or you know a faster method, please feel free to contact me for a pull request.

### Who do I talk to? ###

If there is any questions pertaining to the device, you can reach me at jd1504a@student.american.edu.
PLEASE, in the email topic, include: "ThrowableCamera Bitbucket", then your question.

### Hat Tip ###
Special thanks to Professor Kristof of American University for helping inspire and empower me to complete this project, as well as, help with understanding the hardware side.

Special thanks to Professor Doctor Robinson of American University for pushing me to take bigger risks, making me look at problems more simply, and helping me through the math.
